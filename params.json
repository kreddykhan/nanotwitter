Having completed these basic requirements, students then had to load test their apps and were encouraged to use techniques studied in class to better the quality of their scaling.\r\n\r\n##Team\r\n\r\nWhile the course is designed to be done in groups of three, I was the TA for the course as well as a student enrolled in the course and so attempted the assignment myself.\r\n\r\n##Screenshots\r\n\r\n##Technologies\r\n* Authentication\r\n* Codeship\r\n* Heroku\r\n* Web Servers\r\n* Redis\r\n* Loader.io\r\n\r\n##Interesting Engineering\r\n###Authentication\r\n\r\nThis was done using the BCrypt gem. What this essentially does is run the user entered password through a hash function and then stores it as a password_digest. When the user enters their password it is checked against the password_digest. Neither the password nor the password_digest can be accessed from the database which keeps the user credentials safe.\r\n\r\nSessions are then used to track the current user and thereby limit the current user privileges.\r\n\r\n###Codeship\r\n###Heroku\r\n###Web Servers\r\n###Redis\r\n###Loader.io\r\n\r\n##Result of scalability work, timings etc.\r\n\r\n",
